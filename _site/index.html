    Recently graduated from a <b>Master in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a major in Systems,
    Control and Decision theory (Robotics)</b>. In the past I worked as an <b>undergraduate researcher in the Institute for Systems and Robotics in Lisbon</b> and
    as a machine learning instructor in several venues such as the <b>Lisbon Machine Learning School
    and the Data Science Starters Academy</b>. More recently co-founding the Machine Learning Academy in Lisbon further cemented my knowledge in the field.
    </p>
    <p>
    Wrote Master thesis on the topic of human action prediction in the context of human robot cooperation, the
    results of this work were published in the <b>International Conference on Robotics and Automation</b> and won the
    <b>best national master thesis award from the Portuguese Robotics Society</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Academically, my <b>primary focus is cognitive robotics</b>, robotics systems that learn through, for example, modern machine
    learning techniques, to interact with their environment. Within cognitive robotics, I specialize in human robot
    cooperation and applied machine learning techniques.
