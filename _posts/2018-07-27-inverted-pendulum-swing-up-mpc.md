<p class="abstract">
Reinforcement learning has been applied with remarkable sucess in some classical control problems [1]. While this seems to indicate a good potential for more applications it is still important to look at these problems from a classic perspective to: first, have a strong understanding of how the field developed and, second, to have a broad palette of solutions.

<p>
One such problem is the so called Inverted Pendulum Swing-up problem. This problem's objective is to balance a pendulum in an upright position starting from a resting position, as can be seen in this demonstration video from the University of SÃ£o Paulo:

In this article we will go over all the steps required to solve this problem with the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework:
<ol>
<li><b>Mathematically modelling</b> the systems dynamics using the Lagrangian method. </li>
<li><b>Problem formulation</b> in an optimization setting, defining the cost function and constraints. </li>
<li><b>Optimization</b> solving the problem numerically.</li> 
</ol>
